# Discord Bot - Niklas The Bot
Niklas is a simple bot created in python using the discord.py framework. 
The bot uses ffmpeg and youtube_dl to stream voice to voice chat.

## SETUP:
To setup Niklas create a .env file, follow the '.env.example' file included. You will need a Discord developer account
and a reddit developer account.

All .env variables must be changed to match your installation/tokens/secrets
 et cetera. OR THIS WILL NOT WORK.
 
Bot should run on both Linux and Windows without problems.
